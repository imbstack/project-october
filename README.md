Project October
===============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ted27/project-october.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ted27/project-october)

The three main components of Project October are:

* Frontend https://github.com/ted27/project-october
* Backend https://github.com/rxc178/project-october-backend
* Thrift API https://github.com/bis12/project-october-api

Installing
----------
Update all of the submodules with `git submodule update --init`. Then `bundle install` to get all of the dependencies.

Running
-------
You have two options to get the recommender service running:

* First is to simply start in the development environment and use the remote dev server we're hosting.  (NOTE: This resource is shared between all development, don't muck it up)
* Second is to get the [backend](https://github.com/rxc178/project-october-backend) running yourself.

Then simply execute `rails server` from the top level directory.
